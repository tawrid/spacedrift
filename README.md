## Project Overview

**Space Drift: Mind & Motion** addresses key issues like boredom, isolation, and physical inactivity during long-term space travel. It combines a physical component (guiding a ball through a real-life tube) with a digital counterpart (a microgravity-inspired game), creating a seamless, immersive experience. The game challenges players to guide a ball through obstacles in a weightless environment, simulating the effects of microgravity on movement.

By keeping astronauts engaged both mentally and physically, this game is designed to improve their well-being, reduce stress, and boost cognitive function during space missions.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: A hybrid physical-digital game where players navigate challenges in a microgravity simulation.
- **Focus on Well-being**: Helps improve both mental focus and physical dexterity for astronauts in confined environments.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Offers an engaging experience that bridges the gap between the physical world and the digital game.
- **Adaptable Design**: Can be scaled and customized for various space missions or terrestrial applications like rehabilitation or education.

## How It Works

The project includes both a **physical** and a **digital** component:

1. **Physical Game**: Players use a physical setup with a ball and a tube to mimic real-life challenges of moving objects in microgravity.
2. **Digital Game**: A Unity-based game simulates space challenges where players guide a ball through obstacles in a digital microgravity environment. The game can be played in a web browser and features immersive gameplay that simulates space physics.
3. **Mind and Motion Integration**: The game encourages cognitive focus, problem-solving, and physical coordination, providing an entertaining way to exercise the body and mind in space.

## Demo

You can try out the demo and experience **Space Drift: Mind & Motion** through the following:

- **YouTube Video**: Watch a gameplay walkthrough on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/J4-6fqgA_v4).
- **Play the Game**: You can play the interactive demo of the digital component by launching the Unity WebGL.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: Game engine used to develop the digital component of the microgravity game.
- **WebGL**: Used for browser-based game deployment.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the website that hosts the demo and project details.
- **JavaScript**: For web integration and game interaction logic.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Used for text arrangement and document writing in preparation for the project submission.
