    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p><strong>Space Drift: Mind & Motion</strong> offers a unique gameplay experience that combines fun with mental and physical challenges. Here's how it works:</p>
    
    <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Players must navigate a ball through a transparent tube filled with various obstacles, including rectangular blocks and spheres, without touching them.</li>
        <li><strong>Levels:</strong> The game consists of multiple levels (L1 to L10), each increasing in complexity and challenge.</li>
        <li><strong>Controls:</strong> Players use intuitive controls (keyboard or touch interface) to maneuver the ball within the tube.</li>
        <li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> Different shapes and sizes of obstacles are introduced as players progress through levels, requiring strategic thinking and quick reflexes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Level Progression</h2>
    <p>As players advance through the levels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Levels 1 to 5:</strong> Simpler obstacles allow players to learn the mechanics and improve their skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Levels 6 to 10:</strong> The size of the ball is reduced, increasing difficulty and requiring players to adapt to new challenges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Physical and Digital Versions</h2>
    <p>The game is available in two formats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Physical Version:</strong> Players interact with a tangible setup that enhances hand-eye coordination.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Version:</strong> Offers an immersive experience with dynamic visuals and sounds, making it engaging in a virtual environment.</li>
    </ul>
