    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      In the dynamic realm of space, the effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity environments can be profound; both the body and the mind can experience issues. In addition to health concerns such as the loss of bone density and muscle mass, astronauts can become lonely and bored. The interplay between astronauts' physical and mental well-being is a paramount concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      As humanity ventures further into space, leveraging the unique conditions of microgravity becomes increasingly imperative. Games and recreational activities crafted for Earth's gravity-bound existence fail to harness the potential of this distinct environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, as groups of individuals embark on longer-duration missions and occupy space habitats for increasingly extended periods, the importance of fostering physical fitness, enjoyment, and relaxation amidst the challenges of space habitation becomes evident. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, exploring innovative avenues to enhance spacefarers' mental and physical well-being while capitalizing on the opportunities presented by microgravity is essential.
