    <h1>Design</h1>
    <p>The design of <strong>Space Drift: Mind & Motion</strong> is focused on creating an engaging and challenging experience for players in a microgravity environment. Key design features include:</p>
    
    <h2>Transparent Tube Structure</h2>
    <p>The central gameplay element is a horizontal transparent tube, symbolizing the confined space in which players navigate. This design enhances visibility and immersion.</p>
    
    <h2>Obstacle Variety</h2>
    <p>Inside the tube, a mix of 3D rectangular blocks and spheres creates diverse challenges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rectangular Blocks:</strong> Fixed obstacles that require players to strategize their movements.</li>
        <li><strong>Spheres:</strong> Moving obstacles that add unpredictability to the gameplay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Levels and Difficulty Progression</h2>
    <p>The game features a clear progression system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Levels 1 to 5:</strong> Designed to introduce players to the mechanics with simpler arrangements of obstacles.</li>
        <li><strong>Levels 6 to 10:</strong> Increase in difficulty, with reduced ball size to heighten the challenge.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Aesthetic Elements</h2>
    <p>The background features a cosmic theme, with stars and distant planets to create a sense of exploration. The overall color scheme and visual elements are designed to be visually appealing and engaging.</p>
    
    <h2>Visual Representation</h2>
