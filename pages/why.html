    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      Being in space, or even dealing with extended periods of inactivity, can take a toll on both the body and the mind. Our game was created to combat the mental and physical challenges faced in such environments, offering a way to stay entertained, while also boosting coordination, focus, and mental clarity.
