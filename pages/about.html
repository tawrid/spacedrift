    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our project, <strong>Space Drift: Mind & Motion</strong>. We are a passionate duo driven by a shared enthusiasm for space exploration and the well-being of astronauts.</p>

    <h2>Tawrid Hyder</h2>
    <p>I am Tawrid Hyder, a space enthusiast dedicated to exploring innovative solutions to enhance the physical and mental well-being of astronauts. My fascination with space has inspired me to delve into the unique challenges that astronauts face during long missions, including the impacts of microgravity on both body and mind.</p>

    <h2>Isa Hyder</h2>
    <p>Joining me in this endeavor is my 11-year-old son, Isa Hyder. With a curious mind and a thirst for adventure, Isa shares my passion for space and is eager to contribute to the betterment of those who venture beyond our planet. Together, we aim to develop engaging activities that will help astronauts combat loneliness, boredom, and the physical challenges of living in space.</p>

    <p>Our mission is to leverage our creativity and knowledge to create enjoyable and beneficial experiences for astronauts on long-duration missions. We believe that by addressing the mental and physical challenges they face, we can contribute to their overall well-being and mission success.</p>

    <p>Thank you for joining us on this journey as we explore new frontiers in space health and entertainment!</p>
