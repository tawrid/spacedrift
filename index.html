      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Space Drift: Mind & Motion</strong> is a multi-faceted game designed to tackle the challenges of boredom, mental fatigue, and physical stagnationâ€”especially in space environments. Combining physical interaction with digital gameplay, it helps players stay active, engaged, and sharp.

    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        Being in space, or even dealing with extended periods of inactivity, can take a toll on both the body and the mind. Our game was created to combat the mental and physical challenges faced in such environments, offering a way to stay entertained, while also boosting coordination, focus, and mental clarity.

    <section id="how">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>
        In <strong>Space Drift: Mind & Motion</strong>, the goal is simple: navigate a ball through a tube, avoiding obstacles and overcoming various challenges. You can play either the physical version, where you manually guide a ball through a tangible tube, or the digital version, where you control the ball on screen using touch or motion controls. Both versions are designed to improve hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and problem-solving skills.

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        The design of the game is minimalistic but engaging. The physical version includes a sleek, transparent tube with various obstacles that can be repositioned. The digital version features a futuristic, space-themed interface that evolves as you progress, introducing new challenges and environments as you improve your skills.

      <h2>Technical</h2>
      <p>
        The game is built using modern technologies. The digital version utilizes Unity for the 3D environment and obstacle mechanics, while the physical version is made with durable, lightweight materials for easy handling in both terrestrial and space environments. The digital version is compatible with desktop, mobile, and VR platforms, offering flexible gameplay options.
