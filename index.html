    <h1>Welcome to Space Drift: Mind & Motion</h1>

    <p>
      In the vast, silent stretches of space, keeping the mind sharp and the body active is a challenge unlike any other. 
      <strong>Space Drift: Mind & Motion</strong> is more than just a game—it's a journey designed to help you stay engaged, 
      entertained, and healthy while navigating the depths of the cosmos. Whether you're on a long voyage or simply searching 
      for new ways to challenge yourself, this game brings the fun back into focus.
    </p>

    <h2>Test Your Skills</h2>
    <p>
      Test your skills as you guide a ball through ever-changing tubes, dodging obstacles and defying the forces of space. 
      With each movement, you'll be sharpening your reflexes, boosting your concentration, and keeping boredom at bay. 
      But it’s not just your body that benefits—your mind will be constantly working to predict, strategize, and overcome 
      the challenges ahead.
    </p>

    <h2>Physical and Digital Versions for Every Explorer</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Space Drift</strong> is available in two formats—physical and digital. The physical version lets you engage 
      directly with the game, offering a tactile experience to improve hand-eye coordination and motor skills. The digital 
      version immerses you in a futuristic environment, with dynamic levels that evolve as you progress. Both versions are 
      crafted to help you feel grounded, even in the vast emptiness of space.
